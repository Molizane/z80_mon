Z80 Monitor
===========

Steve Maddison, 12/05/2008

This is a simple Z80 monitor written mainly in C. It implements the tradition
low-level functionality such as reading from and writing to memory addresses,
registers and I/O ports. Eventually it will also feature some simple diagnostics
and bootstraps.

To build you'll require the SDCC compiler and a hex2bin utility, both of which
can be downloaded from SourceForge.
